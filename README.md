# The Big One
The Big One is a frequently updated anonymous IP list. It is designed so you can easily block TOR, VPNs, and proxies, without having to resort to banning entire ASNs. Currently there are 1,907,639 IPs in the blocklist.

THIS IS NOT A PROXY LIST! This is only for blocking, it does not contain ports, passwords, etc.

# How does it work?
The Big One gathers data from several different services, mainly proxy websites/forums, the Tor exit list, as well as scraping different VPN services. It scans many unique proxy websites - some even private, so our list will be able to locate proxies and VPNs that aren't in common free lists. 

We appreciate any feedback, and be sure to report to us if an IP on this list is NOT abusive or used for proxy, VPN, Tor, etc.
